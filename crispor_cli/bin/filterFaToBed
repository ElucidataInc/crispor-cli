# filter fasta file and keep only sequences that end with pattern (if + strand)
# output as a bed file
# CAREFUL: input sequences have to be on a single line. This is different from normal fasta files.

# arguments: guideSeqFaFname pamPat altPats altMinScore passX1Score

# 2nd input fasta is fasta read from stdin, with |-separated fields in the ID line:
# 0 = sequence ID
# 1 = chromosome
# 2 = start pos
# 3 = end pos
# 4 = strand
# 5 = BWA editDist
# 6 = BWA x1Score 
# 7 = position of gap, -1 if not used. Usually not used.

# example input ( with field numbers above the ID line):
# 0     1      2       3       4 5  6    7
#>seq1|chrII|16108096|16108116|+|0|12345|-1
#TCGAAAGTGGTAAGAATTTA

# example output:
# format: (seqId, strand, mismatchCount, seq, x1Score, hitScore (or 0, if it was a pamPat match or X1score) 

# pamPat: 
# pam IUPAC pattern, all sequences that end with this pattern get through
# altPats: comma-sep list of patterns, all sequences with this pattern get only through
#          if they have >altMaxScore. The score is the hitScore as defined in Hsu et al 2013, 
#          see below
#          Can be "na" if not altPat search needed
# altMinScore: hits ending with one of altPats have to exceed this threshold, otherwise 
#          they are skipped
# passX1Score: all sequences that have a field X1Score (field no 6 (0-based count), |-separated) 
#          and where the X1Score is > passX1Score will 
#          pass no matter what. This is to allow X1-exceeding matches to get through, 
#          even if they don't end with the pattern. These matches are a signal from BWA that a sequence
#          exceeded the X1 cutoff, so these are repetitive sequences we filter out.
#          This is needed, as otherwise we couldn't distinguish non-matching from too-repetitive 
#          sequences.
